summary: 'Are the days of forking out massive amounts of capital for an enterprise-worthy website gone? CNET says so. "The days of needing a professional coder to create a website for yourself or your business are over," they say, in an article that lists Squarespace, Wix and Weebly as the top options. (In other words, an article sponsored by Squarespace, Wix and Weebly.) But the question remains: is Drupal still worth it? Yes, says a blog post written by a Drupal dev who is not paid by Drupal for his evanglism services but, yanno, would be okay with that.'

Drupal, you might've heard of it. These days though, it's not super likely that you'll see it listed among the top choices for small businesses who need to build an online presence. Yes, I know, we're talking about a content management system (CMS) that's been in existence since 2001... that's like ancient in tech years. And with so many other highly-recommended options out there, you may be wondering: Why should a small business still consider Drupal?

## Old, But Not Vinegar Just Yet

First and foremost, Drupal is mature, like a fine wine (cliche count: either 3 or 4, I've already lost track). That's not a bad thing! It means that it's stable and has a rich ecosystem of contributed modules, themes, and distributions. The Drupal community is vast and active and is always working on improving the platform. As of Drupal 9, the upgrade path to future versions is smoother than ever. No more big, scary migrations! (Forget those horror stories grandpa likes to tell you about the headaches of migrating from D7 to D8. Remember, grandpa also walked uphill both ways to school, so his judgment is a little sus these days.)

What you get with Drupal is a battle-tested CMS. It's been used by enterprises, governments, educational institutions, and, of course, small businesses. It has survived two Drupal-geddons and we the Drupal community all learned from each one.

## Flexibility, Scalability: Check, Check

Alright, let's get to the nitty-gritty. One of the main reasons you'd want to consider Drupal for your small business is its flexibility and scalability. With Drupal, you can create pretty much any type of website you want. A simple blog? No problem. A multi-language e-commerce store? Drupal's got you covered.

It's all about modular architecture. You can mix and match modules to achieve the desired functionality for your website. "But I can do that with my Wix site!" No, you can't, trust me. And as your business grows, Drupal can grow with it. Need more features or better performance? Just add more modules or fine-tune your configuration. It's like having a CMS that's tailored to your needs, no matter the size of your business.

## Security is a Priority

Security is a big deal for small businesses. You don't want your customers' data getting stolen and leaked, and Drupal takes security seriously. The Drupal Security Team actively monitors and addresses potential vulnerabilities. They work closely with the community to ensure Drupal remains one of the most secure CMS platforms out there.

Additionally, Drupal's granular permissions system allows you to control who has access to what on your website. So, while Drupal can't guarantee a hacker-proof website (nothing can!), it does provide a strong foundation for secure web development.

## So... What About the Costs?

Now, I know what you're thinking. You've heard that Drupal is expensive and hard to learn. Let's put things into perspective with a quote from Forbes.com:

> "A Drupal project with minimal custom development may take around six to eight weeks of work and cost $30,000 to $40,000."

Comparing that to Wix's cost and timeline, it sounds like you'd be a fool to go with the pricier option. And it is pricey if you want it done professionally. I mean, otherwise people like me wouldn't have jobs.

So, yes, Drupal can be expensive if you need custom development. But that's true for any CMS platform! The thing is, Drupal has a vast library of modules and themes that can help you achieve most of what you want without breaking the bank. Plus, it's open-source, so you don't have to pay licensing fees. As for the learning curve, it's true that Drupal might take a bit more time to learn compared to some other CMS platforms. But there are loads of resources available in the vast Drupal community to help you get started; you're never alone.

## Drupal: A Solid Choice for Small Businesses

In conclusion, Drupal may not be the hippest CMS oput there, but it's a solid choice for small businesses for a variety of reasons. It's a mature, flexible, and scalable platform with a strong focus on security. While there may be a learning curve and some costs associated with custom development, the wealth of available resources and the active community make Drupal a viable option for businesses of all sizes.
