summary: Context switching is a skill that you can improve with practice and the right strategies. By clearing your mind, organizing your workspace, reviewing the basics, setting clear boundaries, and practicing, you'll find it easier to transition between different programming languages and projects. On the other hand, trying to do everything at once, ignoring the importance of breaks, and not communicating with your team can hinder your progress.

We have to deal with context switching throughout our lives, and usually it's not very difficult. Before we even started school, we had to learn how to turn our brains off at naptime (not a challenge for some). In school, we became accustomed to spending 45 minutes immersed in one subject, then when the bell rings, switching our brains over to processing a completely different subject. We get our first job and have to add at least one and maybe more contexts to our rotation. In college, the contexts only continue to multiply as we continue to take on new roles.

All of that seems easy to me. It's just part of life. But ask me to jump from working on a JavaScript project that I've been immersed in for a month and quickly ramp up on a PHP codebase? I'm more inclined to turn my brain off and just call it naptime. It's not that I don't enjoy the variety, but sometimes, the mental gymnastics required to go from one language to another can be exhausting. So, I decided to find ways to improve my context switching skills and make those transitions smoother.

## The Struggles of Context Switching

We've all been there, right? You're working on one project, someone or something demands urgent and immediate attention in a project that's built with a different tech stack. And just like that, you're thrown into a completely different programming environment.

It's not just the syntax changes that are jarring; it's also the different ways of thinking, the different libraries and frameworks, and the mental shift required to adjust to the new project's requirements.

## What Works for Me

### 1. Clear Your Mind

When switching from one programming language or environment to another, it's essential to clear your mind and reset your mental state. Take a short nap (that's my go-to answer for a lot of life's perplexities), go for a walk, or do anything that helps you relax and refocus. This mental reset will help you approach the new project with a fresh perspective and make it easier to absorb new information.

### 2. Organize Your Workspace

If Jackie were to ever read my blog, she will probably bust up laughing at this one. I'm a bit cluttery, but I admit: a cluttered workspace can make it challenging to focus and switch between different projects. Keep your physical and digital workspaces organized, with separate folders or repositories for each project. This way, you'll avoid mixing up files, and it'll be easier to find what you need when you need it.

### 3. Review the Basics

Before diving into a new programming language or environment, take a few minutes to review the docs or look at some beginner-level tutorials. I can be a fluent coder in a given language, but still need to bend my brain around the basics as if I'd never seen them. This can include syntax, common functions, and any quirks specific to that language. I love cheatsheets. I have bookmarked cheatsheets for just about every type of file I may touch, just to help me remember the essential concepts and syntax differences.

### 4. Practice, Practice, Practice

The more you switch between programming languages and projects, the better you'll become at context switching. Don't shy away from opportunities to work with different languages or environments, as these experiences will only help you improve your skills.

Context switching is a skill that you can improve with practice and the right strategies. By clearing your mind, organizing your workspace, reviewing the basics, setting clear boundaries, and practicing, you'll find it easier to transition between different programming languages and projects. On the other hand, trying to do everything at once, ignoring the importance of breaks, and not communicating with your team can hinder your progress. It's not always easy, but with patience and persistence, you'll find yourself navigating between different programming languages and environments with relative ease.
