summary: In the RN courses at Nucamp where I'm an instructor, the students learn Expo and RN together with very little delineation between the two. The course being a four-week blitz through RN pretty much necessitates pairing RN and Expo up in order to allow students to jump right in. But are Expo and RN inseparable? What's it like learning  RN without Expo?

React Native is a fantastic tool for mobile app development, but there's another equally fantastic tool that comes into the mix: Expo. Some devs won't consider a project without Expo. Personally, I taught myself RN before I heard about Expo, and I can attest to RN having a higher level of pain-in-the-assedness without Expo.

## What is Expo?

Before we can get into whether or not you should learn React Native without Expo, we should probably talk about what Expo is. Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native that can help streamline the development process. With Expo, you get:

- A smooth development experience, with features like hot reloading and easy debugging
- Access to an array of ready-to-use components and libraries
- The ability to build and deploy your app without touching native code

Sounds pretty good, right? But what if you choose to go without Expo? Let's find out.

## Learning React Native Without Expo: The Pros

As you embark on your React Native journey, you may find that there are some benefits to learning the framework without Expo:

1. **Greater control**: When you learn React Native without Expo, you're working directly with the native modules and libraries that the framework is built on. This means you have greater control over how your app behaves and can make use of native features that may not be available through Expo.

2. **Flexibility**: Without Expo, you're free to pick and choose the libraries and components you want to use in your app. This can be a double-edged sword, as it means more decisions to make, but it also allows you to tailor your app to your specific needs.

3. **Better performance**: In some cases, apps built without Expo might perform better than those built with Expo. This is because Expo can add some overhead to your app, and by working directly with the native modules, you can potentially reduce that overhead.

But, of course, there are two sides to every story.

## Learning React Native Without Expo: The Cons

While there are some benefits to learning React Native without Expo, there are also some drawbacks to consider:

1. **Steep learning curve**: Working directly with the native modules and libraries in React Native can be challenging, especially if you're new to mobile app development. Expo simplifies this process, so learning React Native without Expo might mean more time spent struggling with the intricacies of the framework.

2. **Increased complexity**: As mentioned earlier, working without Expo means making more decisions about which libraries and components to use. This can increase the complexity of your app and make it more difficult to maintain.

3. **More setup and configuration**: When you use Expo, many aspects of your app's setup and configuration are handled for you. Without Expo, you'll need to manage these aspects yourself, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

Now that we've covered the pros and cons, let's explore some other factors that might influence your decision.

## How Comfortable Are You with Native Development?

If you're already familiar with native app development, you may find that learning React Native without Expo is relatively straightforward. In this case, you'll already understand many of the concepts and technologies involved in working with native modules and libraries.

On the other hand, if you're new to mobile app development or have limited experience with native development, learning React Native without Expo might be a more significant challenge. In this situation, you may benefit from the simplified development experience that Expo provides.

## What Are Your App's Requirements?

The requirements of your app can also play a role in whether or not you should learn React Native without Expo. If your app needs to make use of native features or libraries that aren't available through Expo, you'll have no choice but to work without it.

However, if your app's requirements can be met using the components and libraries provided by Expo, you may find that the streamlined development process is worth the trade-offs.

## Your Personal Learning Goals

Another factor to consider is your personal learning goals. If you're interested in becoming a more well-rounded mobile app developer and gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies, learning React Native without Expo could be a valuable experience.

On the other hand, if your primary goal is to quickly build and deploy a React Native app, you might find that learning with Expo allows you to achieve that goal more efficiently.

## The Verdict: It's Up to You, Really

In the end, whether or not you should bother learning React Native without Expo depends on your unique situation and goals. There are pros and cons to both approaches, and what works best for one developer might not be the right choice for another.

If you value greater control, flexibility, and potential performance improvements, learning React Native without Expo might be the right choice for you. However, if you prefer a more streamlined development experience and don't mind some trade-offs, learning with Expo could be the way to go.

Regardless of which path you choose, React Native is a powerful framework for mobile app development, and the skills you gain will serve you well in your development journey. So, go forth, learn, and build amazing apps - with or without Expo, etc.
