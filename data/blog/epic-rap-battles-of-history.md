_(No, ChatGPT didn't write this. I was inspired by Redditors who used GPT to write Epic Rap Battles. I tried it, but no matter how much I tweaked the prompts I couldn't get a result I liked. Their insults would stay at a pretty generic level, and GPT kept wanting to make them have some kumbaya moment at the end.)_

## Round One... BEGIN!

#### Drupal

> Droop Dogg is here, have no fear guys and gals,  
> When it comes to websites, D-R-U is your pal.  
> The CMS King, no debate, I'm the best,  
> WordPress you're a mess, just a Work-In-Progress
>
> I'm customizable for every need and desire,  
> Rolled out in '01, set the tech world on fire  
> Security? I got it, no shit's gettin in  
> But /wp-admin is a hacker's best friend
>
> All you need is a blog? WP is for you...  
> Or maybe Wix, Weebly or Squarespace will do  
> Competition is tight in the old "blog-o-sphere"  
> Competing with me? Pfft, get the fuck out of here.
>
> Need an actual site? Build it on my big framework  
> Cuz with Enterprise sites, I'm your Captain, James Kirk  
> You've tried to keep up, tried to narrow my lead  
> Now sit back and hold on. "Mr. Scott - warp speed!"

#### WordPress

> Back it up now Drupal, time to give me that mic  
> You talk a big game but your users are like...  
> ..."I can't even use this", "what's this shit", "too complex!"  
> Your UI is bloated, yet you call _me_ a mess.
>
> Drupal, you're cute, but you're so not mainstream,  
> Gotta know how to program just to make a new theme.  
> Right out of the box, I'm so easy to use.  
> I got plugins and widgets, I do multisite too.
>
> And speaking of cute, yo D what's that logo?  
> A blue baby? Blue demon? Blue alien? Or... no...  
> It's one of the Teletubbies, but I don't even know  
> If it's Tinky, or Dipsy, or Laa-Laa, or Po.
>
> I'm a one stop-shop, ain't no site I can't do  
> You say I'm just blogs, but you know that's not true  
> Of the web's CMS's I have a 60 percent share  
> Good luck keeping up, but you don't have a prayer.

#### Drupal

> Yo, Wordpress, your rap's as weak as your core  
> I'm the heavyweight champ, who you tryna score?  
> I'm a powerhouse, a fortress, no vulnerability  
> While your plugin shitshow's a goddamn liability
>
> Need to translate your content? Je parle franÃ§ais  
> I've been WCAG compliant since '09 by the way.  
> My control panel's confusing? Sure, if you're coming from Wix.  
> Doesn't take much brain power when you're just posting pics.
>
> You throw around numbers, you got 60 percent,  
> But your users are bloggers, mine? Governments.  
> I got NASA and Tesla, GE, Mickey D's,  
> Harvard, Yale, Princeton... hell the whole Ivy League,  
> I got Smith & Wesson, got the WWE,  
> Got NBC Sports, Weather Channel, Lamborghini,  
> Yep all of their websites are powered by me!  
> You can brag all you want but we both know the truth,  
> I'm old but I'm winning, you're just long in the tooth.

#### WordPress

> You keep saying I'm like Wix or Squarespace,  
> Well here's a big word that I'll press in your face:  
> Gutenberg baby, yeah I had them first,  
> They make my great UI better. Yours? Can't get any worse.
>
> You listed your users, that's an impressive list  
> And I was kinda surprised at the one that you missed  
> The White House website, it was on Drupal too,  
> Til they switched it to me when they got tired of you.
>
> So keep talkin' your shit, but remember your place  
> I'm the champ of this game, I'm the winner of this race.  
> You tried to keep up but you can't match my pace  
> With your blueberry shaped head and dumb grin on your face.

#### Strapi

> Now what have we here, these two sound unhappy.  
> Stop measuring dicks, you're equally crappy.  
> I'm Strapi and scrappy, I'll beat both you grandpappies,  
> I'm open source, headless, and my users? They're happy.
>
> I'm user friendly and I'm API driven  
> Line me up with your endpoint, I'll assume my position  
> At the top of the JAMStack that's where I belong  
> And I'll still be here long after you two are gone
>
> Confusing your users, you both do it well,  
> I serve data with your sequel, which is called GraphQL  
> I'm fast and I'm agile and I'm the new champ  
> Now it's time to put you two genies back in your LAMP
>
> So now you two relics, give the fighting a rest  
> I'm here and it's clear that I am the best.  
> You wanted to be headless, fine... "OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!"  
> I'm the Red Queen, you bitches, and you are both dead.
