Well, folks, it's the end of the road for Drupal 9. The good people at Drupal.org have released Drupal 9.5, and this bad boy is the last feature release in the 9.x series. So, buckle up and let's dive into what this means for you, your sites, and the future of Drupal.

###New Features and Improvements

As expected, the Drupal 9.5 release comes with its fair share of new improvements and functionality, without breaking backward compatibility for public APIs. But beware, because if you're playing around with experimental modules, you might need to update your custom or contributed modules and themes. And if you're a translator, keep an eye out for string changes and additions â€“ just, you know, in case.

### End of the Road for 9.x Series

With Drupal 9.5 being the final release in the 9.x series, it's time to start prepping for a smoother transition to Drupal 10. Get your sites updated to 9.5 first to minimize changes required when upgrading to Drupal 10.

### New Projects? Jump Straight to Drupal 10.0

To all my fellow Drupal enthusiasts starting new projects: listen up, you sexy nerds! Forget about Drupal 9.5 and jump straight to Drupal 10.0 for forward compatibility with later releases. You'll thank me later.

### Future-proofing Your Site

Now, if you want to keep getting those sweet, sweet new features in Drupal 10.1, 10.2, and so on, you better start prepping your site for Drupal 10 this year. Remember, there won't be any more security support for Drupal 9.3.x, so get your shit together and upgrade your site to a supported release ASAP.

To sum it up: Drupal 9.5 is here, and it's your last chance to dance with the 9.x series.
