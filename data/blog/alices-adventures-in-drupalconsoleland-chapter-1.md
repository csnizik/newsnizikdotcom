## Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was beginning to grow tired of sitting at her desk by herself, incessantly typing away at her keyboard. When she became a Drupal developer, she had envisioned endless days of exciting challenges and intriguing problems to solve. But as she stared at her boring blue admin dashboard, she realized that Drupal had become a monotonous routine

Alice was working on a new theme for a client, but the repetitive tasks of creating files and writing boilerplate code drained her enthusiasm. Just then, a peculiar sight caught her eye. A white rabbit with bright pink eyes hopped past her desk, dressed impeccably in a waistcoat and carrying a pocket watch. Alice blinked, unable to believe what she was seeing. As it hurried off, Alice caught a glimpse of a singular and most peculiar word embroidered on the back of its waistcoat, "Drush".

Intrigued by those mysterious five letters, Alice's curiosity was piqued. She hastily got up from her chair and followed the rabbit, determined to uncover the mystery behind this peculiar creature. She eventually followed it down its rabbit-hole, the walls of which were lined with the most amazing Drupal themes she had ever seen. As she descended further, she noticed that the walls of the tunnel were adorned with snippets of code, which her trained eye recognized as .info.yml files and .module files. She was seeing custom modules... not contrib modules, no, these were custom; they had been built by someone right here!

Eventually she came to a hall and there, on a small pedestal, lay a dusty old book, and on its cover she saw that word again: "Drush: The Ultimate Guide for Drupal Developers." Alice picked up the book, and her heart raced as she flipped through the pages, where she saw oodles upon oodles of drush commands. She discovered commands for clearing cache, updating modules, and even creating new themes, all with a few simple keystrokes.

As she perused the book, she realized that she had lost the rabbit. Perhaps he had gone through one of the doors she saw, but which one?

### `drush si` - Alice installs Drupal herself

With those few keystrokes, Alice now found herself in a very strange garden. White rabbits scurried about, each expertly executing Drush commands and working together to create breathtaking digital experiences.

As Alice stepped through the doorway, she felt herself grow taller and more confident. The once-daunting world of Drupal was now her playground, and she felt an overwhelming sense of purpose and excitement. Could she be dreaming? It felt and looked like the waking world... she knew that she was working on a Drupal site... but where was the familiar UI? Why was she only using the command line, and why was every line prefaced with `drush`? Her mind raced, but then she realized she was still holding the book.

"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice.
