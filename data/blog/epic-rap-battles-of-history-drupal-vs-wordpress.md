## Round One

#### Drupal

> Droop Dogg is here, the true open-source baller,
> When it comes to websites, Double D's the shot caller
> The CMS King, no debate, I'm the best,
> WordPress you're a mess, just a Work-In-Progress
>
> I'm customizable for every need and desire,
> Been here since '01, set the tech world on fire
> Security? I got it, no shit's gettin in
> But now /wp-admin is a hacker's best friend
>
> Need an enterprise site? Build it on my framework
> On the SS Enterprise, I'm your Captain, James Kirk
> You've tried to keep up, tried to narrow my lead
> Now sit back, WordPress. "Mr. Scott - warp speed!"
>
> All you need is a blog? WP is for you,
> Or maybe Wix, Weebly or Squarespace will do
> Competition is tight in the "blog-o-sphere"
> Competing with me? Get the fuck out of here.

#### WordPress

> Back it up now Drupal, time to give me that mic
> You talk a big game but your users are like...
> ..."I can't even use this", "what's this shit", "too complex!"
> Your UI is bloated, yet you call _me_ a mess.
>
> Drupal, you're cute, but you're so not mainstream,
> Gotta be a web dev just to make a new theme.
> Right out of the box, I'm so easy to use.
> I got plugins and widgets, I do multisite too.
>
> And speaking of cute, D what's with that logo?
> A blue baby? Blue demon? Blue alien? Or... no...
> It's one of the Teletubbies, but I don't even know
> If it's Tinky, or Dipsy, or Laa-Laa, or Po.
>
> I'm a one stop-shop, ain't no site I can't do
> You say I'm just blogs, but you know that's not true
> Of the web's CMS's I have a 60 percent share
> Good luck keeping up, but you don't have a prayer.

#### Drupal

> Yo, Wordpress, your rap's as weak as your core
> I'm the heavyweight champ, who you tryna score?
> I'm a powerhouse, a fortress, no vulnerability
> While your plugin shitshow's a goddamn liability
>
> React, React Native? Yep they're in my corner.
> And I'm WCAG compliant, an accessible performer.
> My control panel's confusing? Sure, if you're coming from Wix.
> Doesn't take much brain power when you're just posting pics.
>
> You throw around numbers, you got 60 percent,
> But your users are bloggers, mine? Governments,
> I got NASA and Tesla, GE, Mickey D's,
> Harvard, Yale, Princeton... hell the whole Ivy League,
> I got Smith & Wesson, got the WWE,
> Got NBC Sports, Weather Channel, Lamborghini,
> Yep all of their websites are powered by me!
> You can brag all you want but we both know the truth,
> I'm old but I'm but I'm winning, you're just long in the tooth.

#### WordPress

> You're whining, not winning, you're a weak-ass pretender
> You think you're all that, but I'm the real contender
> My community's strong, I'm the king of computing,
> You scare people away, your support's really Drooping.
>
> You listed your users, that's an impressive list
> And I was kinda surprised at the one that you missed
> The White House website, it was on Drupal too,
> Til they switched it to me when they got tired of you.
>
> So keep talkin' your shit, but remember your place
> I'm the champ of this game, and I ain't gonna be replaced
> I'll keep crushin' it, Drupal, while you stay in my shadow
> With your blue face and bug eyes and head like a marshmallow.

#### Strapi

> Whoa what have we here? Are these two still at it?
> For years the tech world has been hearing that shit.
> I'm Strapi and scrappy, I'll beat both these grandpappies,
> I'm headless, I'm simple, keep my userbase happy.
>
> I'm user friendly and I'm API driven
> Line me up with your endpoint, I'll assume my position
> At the top of the JAMStack that's where I belong
> And I'll still be here long after you two are gone
>
> Confusing your users, you both do it well,
> Serving data with your sequel, which is called GraphQL
> I'm fast and I'm agile and I'm the new champ
> Now it's time to put you two genies back in your LAMP
>
> So now you two mummies, give the fighting a rest
> I'm here and it's clear that I am the best.
> You wanted to be headless, fine... "OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!"
> I'm the Red Queen, you bitches, and you are both dead.
