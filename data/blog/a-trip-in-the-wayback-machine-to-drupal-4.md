My first Drupal site was a news site that used Drupal, version 4. This was 2005 and the concept of Content Management Systems was pretty new. I remember trying out Drupal and another open-source CMS, Mambo, and settling on Drupal... though I can't remember why I picked it over Mambo, to be honest.

### The Beginning: Getting Started with Drupal 4

The installation process for Drupal 4 was a bit more tedious than it is today. It required manual database setup and file uploads, which could be intimidating for beginners. However, once the initial setup was complete, the excitement of creating a new website took over.

### Modules: The Building Blocks of a Drupal 4 Site

Drupal 4 had a much smaller selection of contributed modules compared to today's vast ecosystem. Some popular modules at the time included:

- Path: Allowed custom URLs for content
- Taxonomy: Enabled categorization of content
- Throttle: Helped control server load

While the options were limited, they provided the essential tools needed to create a functional news site.

### Theming: Crafting the Look and Feel

Theming in Drupal 4 was less flexible and user-friendly than it is now. With fewer themes available, customizing a site's appearance often meant diving into PHP and CSS code. Still, this hands-on approach allowed site builders to create unique designs tailored to their needs.

### Content Management: Creating and Organizing Content

Creating content in Drupal 4 was a relatively straightforward process. The primary content types available were "story" and "page," which were used to create news articles and static pages, respectively. The Taxonomy module was essential for categorizing and organizing content, helping users navigate through the news site with ease.

### User Management: Building an Online Community

One of the strengths of Drupal 4 was its user management capabilities. It allowed site builders to create custom roles and permissions, empowering them to build thriving online communities. While the interface was less polished than it is today, it provided the necessary tools to engage and manage users effectively.

### Challenges: The Hurdles of Drupal 4 Site Building

While Drupal 4 offered an excellent foundation for creating websites, it wasn't without its challenges:

- Performance: Drupal 4 sites were prone to slow page load times, and caching options were limited.
- Module Compatibility: With fewer contributed modules available, finding compatible modules could be a challenge.
- Learning Curve: The interface and documentation were less refined, making Drupal 4 a bit more challenging to learn and use.

Despite these hurdles, Drupal 4 was a powerful platform that enabled site builders to create feature-rich websites.

### The Evolution: Reflecting on Drupal's Progress

Comparing Drupal 4 to the current version highlights the tremendous progress that has been made. The installation process is now more streamlined, the ecosystem of contributed modules has grown exponentially, and theming has become more flexible and user-friendly. Additionally, advancements in performance, security, and documentation have made Drupal an even more robust and reliable platform.

### Final Thoughts: Embracing the Journey

Building a news site with Drupal 4 in 2005 was an adventure full of challenges and rewards. While the tools and processes were less refined than they are today, the experience provided valuable insights and lessons that helped shape the Drupal community. As we reminisce about Drupal 4, let's appreciate how far we've come and eagerly anticipate the future of Drupal.
